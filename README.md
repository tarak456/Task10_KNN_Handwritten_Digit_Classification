# Task 10 – KNN Handwritten Digit Classification

## Objective
To classify handwritten digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and understand distance-based classification.

## Dataset
- Sklearn Digits Dataset
- 8x8 grayscale images of digits (0–9)

## Approach
- Loaded digits dataset
- Visualized sample digit images
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Trained KNN model with different K values
- Plotted Accuracy vs K graph
- Evaluated model using confusion matrix
- Displayed predicted digit images

## Model Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Results
KNN achieved high accuracy (around 98%) and optimal K value was selected based on performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
